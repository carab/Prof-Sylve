Prof. Sylve's Living Dex
========================

This webapp allows you to keep track of the Pokémon you collected for your Living Dex.
If you don't know what is a Living Dex, here is the explanation : http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Living_Pokédex

This project was born because none of the existing tools fit my expectations :

- Simple
- Mobile-friendly

So please enjoy using this if you need it too, and don't hesitate to ask for features or even to contribute.

## Contributing

As the project is built on the react-webpack Yeoman generator, you can read its readme to know how to start developing : https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack
I'm open to suggestions and reviews concerning the code, as it is my first React application.

## Why "Prof. Sylve" ?

Because a good friend of mine once said "I should be a Pokémon Professor".
